This is my first time learning to use GitHub. I created a repository that includes three assignments.
# Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I used the online Markdown editor Daligner. I worked with the sample text Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland provided by the professor in class. First, I used Daligner to convert the first chapter, “Down the Rabbit-Hole,” into Markdown format. Afterwards, I explored the main features of GitHub, created a repository, and published the Markdown file.
# Assignment 2
For Assignment 2, I used the Internet Archive’s Open Library. First, I downloaded a PDF version of The King of the Golden River, published in 1927, and performed OCR using Google Drive. After cleaning up the text, I used Daligner to convert it into Markdown format. Finally, I uploaded the file to GitHub.
# Assignment 3
For Assignment 3, I used WPS to create an Excel spreadsheet and built a small database of ten recent movies I’ve watched. The database includes the following fields: movie title, director, main actors, genre, duration, language, country, rating, and my own personal rating. Afterwards, I saved the file in CSV format and uploaded it to GitHub.
