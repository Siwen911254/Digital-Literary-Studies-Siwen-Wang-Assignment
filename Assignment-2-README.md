# Assignment 2_README.md
For Assignment 2, I used the Internet Archive’s Open Library. First, I downloaded a PDF version of The King of the Golden River, published in 1927, and performed OCR using Google Drive. After cleaning up the text, I used Daligner to convert it into Markdown format. Finally, I uploaded the file to GitHub.
